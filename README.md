# LuaCraft

**LuaCraft** is a Minecraft plugin that integrates Lua scripting capabilities into [**Paper MC**](https://papermc.io), allowing players to create custom scripts for Minecraft efficiently.

## Commands

- **`/loadscript <script name>`**: Load and execute a specified Lua script.
  
- **`/listscripts`**: List all available Lua scripts that can be loaded.

## Documentation

The Lua directory is located in the server's root folder. The directory contains a `docs` folder with documentation for using LuaCraft. Thereâ€™s enough information provided to help you get started with scripting and experimentation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use features like autocompletion and diagnostics, you will need an environment that supports the Lua Language Server, such as Visual Studio Code with the appropriate extension, or a similar LSP-compatible editor. These tools help you write and manage your Lua scripts more efficiently.
